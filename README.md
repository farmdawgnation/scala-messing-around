# Scala Messing Around
This repository is a small collection of little bits and pieces that I've written in my
journey to learn scala. Most of them are / will be simple sorting algorithms, and other
things of the like.

If you went through basic java classes like me, hopefully you'll find my development of
these algorithms a useful comparison to see how basic tasks are done in Scala.

This repository will likely contain some of the worst coding style you've seen in a long
time. I'm still learning, so shoot me. Feel free to leave me comments on the code regarding
better ways to do things or ways to make it more Scala-like or what have you.
